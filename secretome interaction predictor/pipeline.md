# Cross-Kingdom Secreted Protein Interaction Predictor

A comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline for predicting interactions between secreted proteins across biological kingdoms.

1) Input: Species A, Species B, and interaction context
2) Automated data acquisition (genome / proteome databases)
3) Gene prediction and annotation
4) Multi-pathway secretion prediction
5) Interaction partner matching
6) Functional impact prediction
7) Visualisation and reporting

**Still in progress: Step 1.**
